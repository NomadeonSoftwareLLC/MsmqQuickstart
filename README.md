# MSMQ Quick Start

On unattended or embedded systems, it is often a requirement to reliably deliver messages even when the network is periodically down or the machine is power cycled. When using Windows, [Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Message_Queuing) is an old standby for persistent storage of queued messages. 

This repo provides a quick start sample project for interacting with MSMQ from .NET. More details available [on my blog at nomadeon.com](https://nomadeon.com/2018/06/05/msmq-from-net/)
